# Multimodal intersection model

This is an ABM model of Vehicle-Pedestrian interaction in an intersection. The idea of this model is to explore the dynamics of pedestrians and vehicles at an unsignalized intersection.

## How it works

There are eight entrances for pedestrians (i.e. two sidewalks at each cardinal point). Pedestrians choose their final goal considering at least one road crossing in their trajectory.
